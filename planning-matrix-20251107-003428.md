### Risk Identification

**Risk 1: Content Sources Block Scraping / Rate Limit**

- **Impact:** High (core product depends on content aggregation)
- **Probability:** Medium (some APIs may change policies)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use official APIs where possible
  - Respect rate limits (implement exponential backoff)
  - Have backup sources ready
  - Monitor API health
- **Contingency:** Switch to alternative sources, implement manual curation

**Risk 2: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

- **Impact:** Critical (financial loss, reputation damage)
- **Probability:** Low (with proper testing and audit)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Professional audit ($10k-15k) before mainnet
  - Testnet testing (extensive)
  - Community review
  - Use OpenZeppelin libraries
- **Contingency:** Fix vulnerabilities, redeploy contracts

**Risk 3: Reown + Clerk Integration Complexity**

- **Impact:** High (authentication is critical)
- **Probability:** Medium (new integration pattern)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Reference documentation provided
  - Test integration thoroughly
  - Have support contacts ready
- **Contingency:** Simplify to single auth provider if needed

**Risk 4: IndexedDB Storage Limits on iOS Safari (50 MB)**

- **Impact:** Medium (affects offline functionality)
- **Probability:** Medium (iOS Safari has strict limits)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement aggressive cleanup (keep last 30 days)
  - Warn users when approaching limit
  - Optimize cache size
- **Contingency:** Reduce cache size, implement cloud sync

**Risk 5: Low Ad Demand (No Advertisers)**

- **Impact:** High (revenue generation depends on ads)
- **Probability:** Medium (new platform, unproven)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with own ads
  - Approach crypto projects directly
  - Referral incentives
  - Lower minimum bids if needed
- **Contingency:** Focus on subscription revenue, adjust pricing

**Risk 6: Points Economy Imbalance (Too Many Conversions)**

- **Impact:** High (financial sustainability)
- **Probability:** Medium (new economy, untested)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor ratio (issue vs redeem)
  - Adjust conversion rate via DAO
  - Implement cooldowns
  - Reduce earning rates if needed
- **Contingency:** Pause conversions, adjust economy parameters

**Risk 7: Low User Adoption**

- **Impact:** High (project success depends on users)
- **Probability:** Medium (competitive market)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Marketing campaign
  - Partnerships with crypto projects
  - Influencer promotions
  - Referral program
- **Contingency:** Pivot to B2B (enterprise aggregator)

**Risk 8: Regulatory Compliance Issues**

- **Impact:** High (legal risks, shutdown)
- **Probability:** Low (points as utility, not securities)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Legal review
  - Terms of service (points as utility)
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance
  - Privacy policy
- **Contingency:** Adjust tokenomics, seek legal counsel

**Risk 9: Performance Issues at Scale**

- **Impact:** Medium (user experience degradation)
- **Probability:** Low (client-side architecture scales well)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Performance testing (10,000 DAU target)
  - Virtual scrolling
  - Aggressive caching
  - Monitor Web Vitals
- **Contingency:** Optimize queries, implement pagination
